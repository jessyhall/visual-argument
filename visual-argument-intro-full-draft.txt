The idea i had for this project was to make something that reminds people that driving drunk isn’t the only thing that will give you a DUI. I’m not sure if it’s still a big issue, but when I was in high school I remember a lot of people would be like “oh I’m just high I can still drive,” when that’s simply not how it works. I used something that rhymes, “driving high is still a DUI” so that it is easy to remember and hopefully would get stuck in people’s heads. I used green text for the word high to imply that I'm referring to weed, and red text for DUI to show that it's bad and not something you want. I added a blur feature to the car to attempt to show that it's moving, and added smoke coming out of the driver side window to further show I'm referring to weed use while driving. I left the background black so it was plain and didn't take away from the message I'm trying to get across.
