The idea i had for this project was to make something that reminds people that driving drunk isn’t the only thing that will give you a DUI. I’m not sure if it’s still a big issue, but when iI was in high school I remember a lot of people would be like “oh I’m just high I can still drive,” when that’s simply not how it works. I used something that rhymes, “driving high is still a DUI” so that it is easy to remember and hopefully would get stuck in people’s heads.
